    <h1>Hello there! This is the back story</h1>
    
    <p id="back-story", >
      On the mystical island of Zanith, a small town falls under the shadow of the once grand and lively fortress. Once home to the king of the island,
      The fort was abandoned after the king had a new citadel constructed further north. Over the years the fort began to crumble and its superior 
      presence faded into the past. Recently noises have been heard from the fort and the occasional glimpse of a torch light can be seen from the crumbling towers.
      The villagers have also noticed a darker presence in the village and an increased amount of dark spawn attacking the village. The mayor of the town
      has put out a request for adventurers to find the source of darkness from within the fort but none have returned. Your are the next adventurer to test
      their might against the evil within the fort. Will you rise to the challenge and destroy the source of evil when so many have failed before you?
